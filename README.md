# SPVibA
Vibration analysis of sandwich plates using artificial intelligence methods

This Matlab application calculates the eigenfrequencies and loss factors of a sandwich plate containing two face layers of aluminium and a core layer of natural rubber. The user can select the boundary conditions of the plate and the cutout shape, the normalized coordinates of the position of the cutout and the normalized size of the cutout. 

For the calculation of the eigenproperties of the sandwich plate SPVibA uses only feedforward Artificial Neural Networks, which have been trained on an extensive training dataset taken from experiments and FEA analyses.

Install this app by using the "APPS" tab of the Matlab window -> "Install App" then select the mlappinstall file of this repository. 

Users are encouraged to provide feedback regarding the use or improvement of this application.
